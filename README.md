# FM AI Assistent for Linux and Windows

FM AI Assistent is an AI assistant companion for Football Manager 26 running on Linux or Windows 11.

It reads FM26 data from RAM and makes the data available to AI assistants through MCP. An AI assistant can use this information to help with buying and selling players, finding profitable young talents, comparing squads, checking club finances, and giving tactical advice based on the players in your save.

The app also includes a frontend where you can search and filter the data yourself. You can inspect players, clubs, competitions, attributes, positions, reputations, contracts, salaries, asking prices, and budgets.

## How To Install

### Option 1: Native Image

Download the native image.

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./fm-ai-assistent
```

Start it from a terminal:

```bash
./fm-ai-assistent
```

### Option 2: Java Jar

Minimum requirement: Java 25.

Download the jar and run:

```bash
java -jar ./fm-ai-assistent.jar
```

On Windows, run the command from PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```powershell
java -jar .\fm-ai-assistent.jar
```

Start FM26 and load a save before loading RAM data. Run FM AI Assistent as the same Windows user as FM26. Administrator privileges are normally not required, but may be needed if FM26 itself was started as administrator.

The application starts on:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Option 3: Run from source (development)

Requirements: JDK 25 and Maven 3.9+ (on Windows use `mvn.cmd`, not the `mvn` shell script).

Build and start:

```bash
mvn.cmd -DskipTests package
java -jar target/fm-ai-assistent-0.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Or start directly with Maven:

```bash
mvn.cmd spring-boot:run
```

The application starts on http://127.0.0.1:8080. Keep FM26 running with a save loaded, then click "Load from RAM" in the UI before using the MCP tools.

## Use AI Assistent

Keep FM26 running with your save loaded. Start FM AI Assistent and Load data (not necessary but be wise with your tokens) before using the MCP tools.

### Codex

Add the MCP server in a terminal:

```bash
codex mcp add fmaiassistent --url http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp

Restart Codex or start a new Codex session after adding the MCP.

i am playing as Feyenoord, i am looking for a new DL that can play in possession as a inverted full back and out of possession as a holding full back. I want the new player to become a immediatly starter or a young player
  that becomes better then my current DL. use the fmaiassistent mcp.

Best pick depends on money.

  1. Ramon Hendriks, Stuttgart
  Best answer if you can stretch above budget.
  CA 135 / PA 145, age 23, £11.85m, £13.3k/w. D(LC), DL 19, DC 20, DM 13.
  Starter now over Smal/Bos, and higher ceiling than Bos. Holding FB fit good: marking 14, tackling 14, positioning 13, strength 16, pace 16, work rate 17. Inverted possession okay, not elite: passing 11, first touch 11,
  technique 11.

  2. Jayden Oosterwolde, Fenerbahce
  Best immediate starter inside current budget.
  CA 135 / PA 140, age 24, £8.2m, £35.4k/w. D(LC), DL 16, DC 20.
  Strong holding FB: tackling 15, marking 14, strength 15, pace 16, teamwork 16, bravery 18. But inverted possession weaker: first touch 8, technique 11, vision 9. Also temperament 3 = discipline/personality risk.

  3. Frans Kratzig, Salzburg
  Best tactical fit for inverted full back, but not immediate upgrade.
  CA 126 / PA 140, age 22, £4.75m, £16.6k/w. D/WB(L), DM, M(C), DL 20, WBL 18, DM 15, MC 15.
  Possession fit strong: technique 15, first touch 14, passing 13, teamwork 16, versatility 19. Weak as holding FB: marking 9, positioning 10, strength 8. Ceiling equals Bos, not clearly better.

  4. Jesus Angulo, Tigres
  Solid immediate defensive option.
  CA 133 / PA 138, age 27, £6.85m, £14.4k/w. D(LC), WB(L), DL 20, DC 20.
  Good holding FB: positioning 15, tackling 14, marking 13, concentration 14, composure 14. Possession okay only: passing 12, technique 12. No DM/MC fit.

  Avoid for this role
  Jan-Niklas Beste: CA 135 and affordable at £8.55m, but more winger/playmaker than holding full back. Marking 9, positioning 9, strength 9, no DM.
  John Tolkin: cheap, nice squad option, but CA 123. Not starter over Smal/Bos.

  My call: Ramon Hendriks if you can raise ~£3m extra. If budget fixed, buy Oosterwolde for immediate XI or Kratzig if you value role fit and development over current CA.

First XI

  GK: Wellenreuther
  Good SK/BPGK fit. Kicking 15, throwing 15, rushing out 14, one-on-ones 15.

  DL: Smal for now
  Best current DL. Passing 14, concentration 15, work rate 15. Bos has more PA but lower now.

  DC: Watanabe
  Best pure CB. CA 136, marking/tackling/positioning 14, teamwork 15.

  DC: Ahmedhodzic as BPD
  Passing 13, vision 13, composure 13. Not elite BPD, but best fit next to Watanabe.

  DR: Read
  Must start. CA 136/PA 152. Great IWB/pressing FB hybrid: passing 14, first touch 14, technique 14, pace 15, DR 20, DM 13.

  DMC: Moder
  Better than Hwang for DLP/DM balance. DM 19, MC 20, passing 14, tackling 13, strength 13.

  MC: Hwang
  Best player. Use as main playmaker, not DMC stopper. Passing 16, technique 16, decisions 16, teamwork 18.

  MC: Sem Steijn
  Best advanced CM. CA 139. Off ball 17, decisions 15, first touch/technique/vision 15. Presses well: work rate 17.

  AML: Sterling
  Best wide forward. Dribbling 15, off ball 17, acceleration 15, AM(L) 20.

  AMR: Hadj Moussa
  Best natural right winger. Left-footed, AMR 20, dribbling 17, crossing 14. Risk: teamwork 9, determination 5, consistency 9.

  ST: Ueda
  Best striker. Finishing 15, composure 15, anticipation 15, work rate 17.

  Definite Upgrades

  1. DL
     Biggest hole. Smal 131, Bos 129. For your IFB/HFB role, buy Ramon Hendriks if possible. If budget fixed, Oosterwolde or Kratzig depending on need.

  2. AMR
     Hadj Moussa has talent but bad mental profile for possession/pressing. Need more reliable winger: teamwork, decisions, work rate, consistency.

  3. BPD
     Ahmedhodzic okay, not top. Need CB with passing 14+, composure 14+, decisions 14+, plus normal CB defending.

  Tactic Changes

  Change ST in possession: Deep Lying Forward -> Advanced Forward or Pressing Forward.
  Ueda is scorer/runner, not creator. Passing 10, first touch 12. His best stuff is finishing, off ball, work rate, aggression.

  Change DMC: Deep Lying Playmaker -> Defensive Midfielder / Half Back if Hwang plays MC.
  Moder can pass enough, but team already has Hwang + Steijn. You need rest defence because both fullbacks invert/step in.

  Change AMR out of possession: Winger -> Pressing Winger only if Hadj Moussa accepts it.
  He has pace/dribble, but weak teamwork/determination. If he underperforms, use Valente AMR for more team structure.

  Change left side: keep Sterling Wide Forward, but DL should be more conservative.
  Smal/Hendriks as holding/inverting support behind Sterling. Do not make DL too aggressive.

  Best shape with current squad: asymmetric possession. Read inverts from right, Smal holds left, Hwang controls MC, Steijn attacks, Ueda runs channels.
